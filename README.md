# PomodoroTimer

Welcome to my Pomodoro Timer project.

## What is Pomodoro ?

Pomodoro is a work method designed to improve concentration, and therefore productivity. 
It consists in fully focusing on the work for a fixed amount of time (usually 25 minutes) and then taking a short break (usually 5 minutes).

Each iteration of this process will help you progress on your project without any stress.

## Application's features

On the app's page, you can start the timer by clicking the triangle icon.
The default work time is 25 minutes, and after that time, the timer will automatically switch to break mode, wich is indicated in the upper status bar.

If the default timer durations don't fit your needs, you can change the duration of both working and break time. Make sure no timer is running though. If that's the case, just click on the arrow icon to stop the running timer.
